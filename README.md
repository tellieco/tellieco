## 👋 Hi, I'm Krystle

## 🔥 About Me
 I have a background in product development, focusing on third-party integrations, API management, and back-office enhancements. I worked closely with software providers throughout the product lifecycle—integrating solutions, managing the backlog, overseeing testing, and ensuring smooth deployments. I also handled product releases, continuous improvements, and troubleshooting to keep everything running efficiently.

Lately, I’ve been expanding my technical skills—learning programming, scripting, and cloud troubleshooting. I’m completing the AWS re/Start program this March and starting a Software Engineering program in April. 🚀
